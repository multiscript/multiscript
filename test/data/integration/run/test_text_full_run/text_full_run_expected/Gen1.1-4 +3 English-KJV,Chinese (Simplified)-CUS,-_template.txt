Genesis 1:1-4, 27-31

King James Version

1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. 31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

1:1 起初，　神创造天地。 2 地是空虚混沌，渊面黑暗；　神的灵运行在水面上。 3 神说：「要有光」，就有了光。 4 神看光是好的，就把光暗分开了。

27 神就照着自己的形像造人，乃是照着他的形像造男造女。 28 神就赐福给他们，又对他们说：「要生养众多，遍满地面，治理这地，也要管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟，和地上各样行动的活物。」 29 神说：「看哪，我将遍地上一切结种子的菜蔬和一切树上所结有核的果子全赐给你们作食物。 30 至于地上的走兽和空中的飞鸟，并各样爬在地上有生命的物，我将青草赐给它们作食物。」事就这样成了。 31 神看着一切所造的都甚好。有晚上，有早晨，是第六日。

Mark 1:1-3, 14-19

1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. 16 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 19 And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.

1:1 神的儿子，耶稣基督福音的起头。 2 正如先知以赛亚（有古卷没有以赛亚三个字）书上记着说：看哪，我要差遣我的使者在你前面，预备道路。 3 在旷野有人声喊着说：预备主的道，修直他的路。

14 约翰下监以后，耶稣来到加利利，宣传　神的福音， 15 说：「日期满了，　神的国近了。你们当悔改，信福音！」 16 耶稣顺着加利利的海边走，看见西门和西门的兄弟安得烈在海里撒网；他们本是打鱼的。 17 耶稣对他们说：「来跟从我，我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。」 18 他们就立刻舍了网，跟从了他。 19 耶稣稍往前走，又见西庇太的儿子雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰在船上补网。
