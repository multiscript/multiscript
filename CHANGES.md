- 0.17.0
  - New features:
    - MS Word outputs set the table-style header-row toggle for passage-group tables containg version names. You may need to update your Word templates. (The table-styles in the built-in template have been updated.)
    - Much better support for right-to-left scripts (like Hebrew, Arabic). Right-to-left text can be set with a checkbox on each Bible version. Automatic font detection will also automatically detect right-to-left scripts.
    - Copyright text is now saved with Bible versions and can be edited.
    - The locations of templates and output folders are now saved relative to the plan file if they're in the same folder or a subfolder. This makes it easier to move a folder containing a plan, its template and its output folder, without needing to update any locations.
    - Output files are now only generated if they need to change. As part of the implementation, a hidden file named ".multiscript.mrun" is generated in each output folder when the plan is run. (It contains metadata about the output files, like file modification times.) There is a new toggle in the plan options to always overwrite the output files. The application settings controlling when to generate outputs have been removed.
    - By default, copies of template outputs are included as normal output files (with unfilled tags removed). This can be turned off in the plan options.
    - Paragraph formatting in MS Word is now applied by default to the styles, rather than the text directly. This can be changed in the plan options.
  - Other changes:
    - Update to fontfinder 0.13.0
    - The internal JSON of plan files no longer escapes non-ASCII unicode characters.
    - Changed add/remove column buttons to "Increase Versions per Passage" and "Decrease", to hopefully better distinguish them from the "Add Versions to Plan..." and "Remove" buttons.
- 0.16.0
  - New font-related features:
    - Automatically select fonts for Bible versions (which can be overridden).
    - When available, automatically download and install fonts used by Bible versions.
    - Both these new features currently limited to the Google Noto font collection.
  - Improve UI updating when listing available versions is a long-running operation (by allowing Bible sources
    to report progressive results).
  - Update dependencies (including to Qt 6.6 and Pyinstaller 6.6)
- 0.15.0
  - Update to new v2 API for GetBible.net
- 0.14.0
  - Uses a brand new Bible reference parser: [bibleref](https://pypi.org/project/bibleref/) (also by the
    Multiscript project). For the first time, book names do not need to be repeated, and commas and semicolons in
    Bible references work as expected. For example: Mark 3:1-4:2; 5:6-8, 10; Matt 10; 11. As before, passages
    separated by a comma are considered to be part of one group (i.e. usually appear in a single table, separated by an ellipsis). Passages separated by a semicolon are considered to be in separate groups (i.e. separate tables).
